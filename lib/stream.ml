  (* TODO: we could abide by the following by either 1) having I/O runtime

     after we've sent an RST_STREAM?

     From RFC7540ยง5.4.2:
       Normally, an endpoint SHOULD NOT send more than one RST_STREAM frame for
       any stream. However, an endpoint MAY send additional RST_STREAM frames
       if it receives frames on a closed stream after more than a round-trip
       time. This behavior is permitted to deal with misbehaving
       implementations. *)
